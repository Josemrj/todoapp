# Todo App - RESTful CRUD API

This repository is dedicated to the development of a complete application using the following technologies:

- **C# (C-Sharp)** to create a RESTful API with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database to store the tasks.
- **React TypeScript (Ts)** for the front-end, providing an interactive and responsive user interface.
